# Suggession Mining

State of the art opinion mining systems provide summaries of positive and negative sentiments of various aspects of a product. On closer look, these opinions
also contain suggestions, advices, or tips. Brand owners or product developers often explicitly sought these suggestions for further product enhancement.

In this project we aim to extract these suggestions from user generated content like discussion forums, consumer reviews, etc.
